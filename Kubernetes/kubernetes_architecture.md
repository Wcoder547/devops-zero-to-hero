# ⚙️ Kubernetes Architecture – A Deep Dive

![Kubernetes Architecture Diagram](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize\:fit:1400/1*0Sudxeu5mQyN3ahi1FV49A.png)

Kubernetes is a **powerful container orchestration platform** that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. At its core, it follows a **client-server architecture** made up of **Control Plane (Master Node)** components and **Worker Node** components.

---

## 🧠 Control Plane (Master Node)

The Control Plane is the **brain of the Kubernetes cluster**. It manages the cluster’s overall state and performs critical decision-making functions.

### 🔹 API Server (`kube-apiserver`)

* Acts as the **entry point** to the cluster.
* All administrative tasks and external communications go through it.
* It validates requests and forwards them to the appropriate components.
* Serves as the communication hub using RESTful APIs.

> Think of it as the **reception desk** or **central command center** of Kubernetes.

---

### 🔹 etcd

* A distributed, highly available **key-value store**.
* Stores all **cluster state data** (nodes, pods, configs, secrets, etc.).
* Acts as the **source of truth** for the cluster.
* Backing up etcd is critical for disaster recovery.

> Imagine `etcd` as the **memory** or **database** of your cluster.

---

### 🔹 Scheduler (`kube-scheduler`)

* Watches for new Pods that need to be scheduled.
* Selects the best node to place each Pod based on:

  * CPU/memory availability
  * Node affinity
  * Taints/tolerations
  * Resource requirements

> Think of the Scheduler as an **automated placement agent** or **matchmaker**.

---

### 🔹 Controller Manager (`kube-controller-manager`)

* Runs various built-in controllers (logic loops) that manage:

  * Nodes
  * Replicasets
  * Endpoints
  * Deployments
* Monitors the current cluster state and ensures it matches the **desired state**.

> It's like having **mini-robots constantly fixing and adjusting** your cluster.

---

### 🔹 Cloud Controller Manager

* Enables Kubernetes to interact with cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or GCP.
* Manages:

  * Load balancers
  * Storage volumes
  * Networking routes
  * Node lifecycle in the cloud

> Acts as a **cloud adapter** connecting Kubernetes to cloud-native features.

---

## 🧱 Worker Node Components

Each worker node runs the actual **workloads** (containers) and reports back to the Control Plane.

### 🔸 kubelet

* Agent that runs on each node.
* Receives Pod specs from the API server and ensures the containers are running.
* Monitors container health and reports node status.

> Think of it as the **node supervisor**.

---

### 🔸 kube-proxy

* Handles **network traffic routing** on each node.
* Uses iptables or IPVS to maintain network rules.
* Forwards requests to the correct Pod across nodes or clusters.

> It’s the **network traffic cop** ensuring packets reach the right Pod.

---

### 🔸 Container Runtime

* Software that runs containers (e.g., Docker, containerd, CRI-O).
* Kubernetes supports any runtime that conforms to the **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)**.

> It's the **engine** that runs the actual containers.

---

## 📦 Other Key Components

### 🧊 Pod

* The **smallest deployable unit** in Kubernetes.
* A Pod wraps one or more containers that share storage, network, and lifecycle.
* All containers in a Pod run on the **same node**.

> Think of it like a **single apartment unit** housing multiple roommates (containers).

---

### 🛰️ Service

* Exposes Pods under a stable **network identity (IP + DNS name)**.
* Ensures reliable communication, even when Pods die and restart.
* Types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName.

> Acts like a **dynamic phonebook or DNS system**.

---

### 💾 Volume

* Persistent storage attached to Pods.
* Outlives the lifecycle of containers.
* Can be local, cloud-based (EBS, GCE), or network-based (NFS, GlusterFS).

> Like an **external hard drive** connected to your app.

---

### 🗂️ Namespace

* Logical separation within a cluster.
* Useful for multi-tenant environments or organizing resources (dev, staging, prod).

> It’s like **different workspaces or project folders** inside the same system.

---

### 🌐 Ingress

* Manages **external access** (HTTP/HTTPS) to services.
* Routes traffic based on rules (e.g., path, domain).
* Can perform SSL termination, load balancing, and more.

> It's your app’s **front door and traffic director**.
